Effortlessly block users from accessing the WordPress admin panel by assigning them a custom 'Blocked' role. Simple, effective, and reliable.

User Role Protector is a lightweight and intuitive plugin designed to block users from accessing the WordPress admin panel. Assign the custom Blocked role to any user, and they’ll be redirected to a “blocked” page instead of the admin panel when they try to log in.
